# GIGACHAD
First of all I want to say this is not a serious project there are probably a lot of better options to make the code. I just wanted to try to make animation using javascript.

## Idea
This project's idea is to recreate [this video from youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZEfN5z8Mlg) using html, css and javascript.

## Known bugs

1. Leaving the window in middle of the animation zooms the current **GIGACHAD** to full size without any transition.
2. When starting the animation it sometimes starts the audio 2 times.

I will probably fix these bugs in the future. If you have any other bugs you would like to report feel free to report them on the discussions tab of this repo.
